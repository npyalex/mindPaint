# mindPaint
Arduino-to-p5 project for OCAD Digital Futures M.Des 2018

### Overview
A user sits comfortably and wears a headset (certainly not a repurposed MindFlex headset from NeuroSky). Their attention and brain waves are used to generate a reactive work of art on a screen. The functions of the user's mind are used to create visual and audible artwork, while spectators get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of another.

### Special Thanks
This project wouldn't have been possible without the work of
Arturo Vidich, Sofy Yuditskaya and Eric Mika
from Frontier Nerds and the Mental Block project
